# One Month Rails

<p/>This is my first attempt at using Github and the first application using Rub on Rails, thanks to our teacher Matt! which has been kind to share his skills with the rest of us. This is pinteresting sample application for [*One Month rails*] (http:onemonthrails.com) by yours truly [gidiup] (https://github.com/gidiup/Pinteresting)<p/>
<p/>I plan to now use an example of this app to keep track of Rx!<p?>
